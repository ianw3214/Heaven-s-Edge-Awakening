# Devlog 001

## Setup

The game is written over a custom engine, so a lot of the core functionality is already written. The main game is written over a base State class that contains virtual functions that I can overwrite with the actual game functionality I want. Things like update and render loops are handled by the engine so I can focus on the actual gameplay.

I'm trying to program in a more *data oriented approach* this time, so instead of putting the entities in their own class with their own functions to call, I simply group entity properties in struct and put all the functionality in the main game. To be honest, this is quite new for me so I'm not sure if I'm even approaching my code correctly.

## Platformer mechanics

For the platforms of the game, I just use a vector of booleans to represent if the tile is collidable, and the tilemap that is rendered is based off a vector of integers representing the tile index as well.

Entity movement is done one direction at a time. After moving the entity a certain distance in the specified direction, the game checks for any collisions that may have been triggered. If a collision occurs, then the entity is moved back one unit, and this repeats until the entity is no longer colliding with anything. My implementation is not efficient at the moment, and there are many optimizations I could make. For one, I am checking collisions against every single tile, where only a few near the entity needs to be checked. Also, I could use a different kind of stepping instead of moving one unit at a time to bring the time down to *O(log n)*.

Gravity is implemented by adding a *y velocity* property to the player. Every frame, gravity is applied depending on the delta time to the player, and the y velocity is increased in the according direction. As a result, jumps are easily implmented by suddenly changing the y velocity to a certain value in the up direction.

## Arrow mechanics

I don't have a solid plan for the game yet, but I want the combat to be both simple and engaging. As such, I decided that the player would use a bow and arrow as the main weapon, since it isn't as straight forward to use as a gun so higher skill would be required to play the game.

The hardest part of implementing arrows is the angle of the arrow every frame. To implement them, I keep track of their *horizontal velocity* as well as their *vertical velocity*, similar to the y velocity of the player. Then, on every frame I use the two velocities as the two sides of a right angle triangle, and thus taking the inverse tangent would give me the right angle. One distinction is that I use the **std::atan2** function instead of std::atan, so that the quadrant will also be considered when calculating the angle. This is because the range of the tangent function is only half a circle (or PI), which means the calculated angle will only be within a range of half a circle.

For arrow collisions, I construct a line based on the angle of the circle to check with other collision boxes. Similar to before, I am currently checking the collisions against every tile so there are definitely ways to optimize the code. A small note on arrow collisions is that I don't move them back to where they weren't colliding, so it gives off the impression that they slightly 'penetrated' the tile that they are shot into.
