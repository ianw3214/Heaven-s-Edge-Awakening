% GAME OVERVIEW %
\section{Overview}
\hspace*{1cm}
Heaven's Edge: Awakening is a 2D MMORPG in a classic fantasy setting. Players will have the choice of many races and professions to customize their characters, and band together with other players to fight their way through the evils of the world. The goal of the game would be to eventually defeat \textbf{EVIL BOSS NAME}, and more powerful forces can be added for expansion content.

% DESIGN PHILOSOPHIES %
\section{Design Philosophies}
There are 3 core design philosophies that the game revolves around.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The combat should feel smooth and fun; fighting should never feel boring
    \item The game should encourage a strong sense of community
    \item \textbf{SOMETHING ELSE I GUESS}
\end{enumerate}

% STORY %
\section{Story}
\hspace*{1cm}
Every player's character was once a minion of \textbf{EVIL BOSS NAME}. After a long and treacherous war, five heros were able to seal away \textbf{EVIL BOSS NAME} and the player's characters were able to regain control of their own bodies, allowing them to lead normal lives again. The player's characters are starting their lives from scratch again as adventureres, regaining their strength to prevent the same fate from happening again.

% GAMEPLAY %
\section{Gameplay}
\hspace*{1cm}
A big part of the game will be combat, and the combat should feel fluid and nice to play. To aid this, dodge rolls will be a big part of combat, allowing the player to make smarter choices in combat rather than just tanking damage. Every encounter should require some thought from the player and not just be a mindless battle, no matter what stage of the game the player is at. Enemies have a variety of mechanics to make sure the combat never gets stale or boring. \\
\hspace*{1cm}
Outside of combat, there will be some social aspects in the gameplay as well. Mainly, a guild feature should unite players together and encourage more social play.

% ART %
\section{Art}
\hspace*{1cm}
The art of the game is done in pixel art combined with some cinematic effects, similar to that of \href{http://store.steampowered.com/app/612400/The_Last_Night/}{The Last Night}. However, the assets will be top down 2D as opposed to the platformer side view.

% SOUND/MUSIC %
\section{Sound/Music}
\hspace*{1cm}
The goal of the sound/music in the game is to help the player feel epic and wonderous during combat. As such, most of the music will consist of orchestral music with powerful yet simple melodies to provide a fitting mood while not taking over all the attention from the player.   \\
\hspace*{1cm}
Since the game is done in pixel art, there will be some 8 bit sounds in the game, for example, an interaction sound. However, the goal is to stray away from a traditional pixel game so many sounds will be like those heard in modern realistic RPGs.
